    <h1>Admission in Scholastica</h1>
    <p><img src="img/admission.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="about image">
     The admissions process in Scholastica is very transparent. Anyone is welcome to apply without any reference. Absolutely no donations are accepted; only published fees are required. </p>
      <p>During the admissions process, interviews are held by a panel of senior management, not a single individual. The interview panel is a team of qualified individuals from Scholastica's senior management. All decisions for admission are made through a committee, not by any one individual.</p>
      <p>No external agents/agencies are appointed or involved in the admissions process; the Admissions Office is the only point of contact for all admissions-related applications and inquiries. No Ascent Group personnel have a role in the admissions process except those in the Admissions Office and on the interview and selection panel. </p>
